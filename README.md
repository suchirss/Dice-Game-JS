# Dice-Game-JS

This is a two player game.
Objective: To win against an opponent by getting to a score of 100 first. 

Rules: 
- Press the hold button to save your current score to your total score and end your turn.
- If you roll a 1, your current score will be wiped (the total score will remain) and your turn will end. 
- Press new game to start a new game.

Features: 
- buttons: roll random dice, hold, new game
- logs current score and total score
- dice rolls are random
- stylistic changes to the webpage based on game events: switching turns, winning

Used the following programming techniques in JavaScript:
- eventListener functions for buttons
- DOM Manipulation of classes and IDs
- functions for summing of current and total scores and to reset the game
- Math.random() and Math.trunc() for random dice rolls
